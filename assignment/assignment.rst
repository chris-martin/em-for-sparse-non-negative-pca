CSE6740/CS7641: Course Project Submission
=========================================
Due: 2012-JUL-26

You should now have a set of algorithms, datasets, and results that replicate what is reported
in your group’s project paper. Now we need to evaluate the results. The objective of the ﬁnal
report is to describe the previous results as well as your experiments, highlighting any diﬀerences
you observed. Additionally, you should make an argument for why the results support the claims
of the paper. You should include any additional experiments that would support the claims of the
paper, or clarify any ambiguities you observed.

What to submit
--------------
Your submissions need to include:
1. A link to or copy of the paper your group used for the project.
2. Source code for your algorithm implementations, including build or compiling instructions.
3. Project report.

Project report elements
-----------------------
Your report needs to include:
1. A summary of the paper you used, detailing the algorithms and experiments used.
2. A description of your implementations of the algorithms.
3. Your results from running the experiements, including a comparison to the paper results.
4. An analysis and assessment of the experiments. Does the empirical evidence support the claims made in the paper?
5. Additional experiments and results that could support or extend the claims of the paper.
